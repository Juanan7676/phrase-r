North Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) forecasts from four ensemble prediction systems (EPSs) are verified using the National Hurricane Center’s (NHC) best tracks for the 2008–15 seasons. The 1–5-day forecasts are evaluated for the 21-member National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the 23-member UKMO ensemble (UKMET), and the 51-member European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble, as well as a combination of these ensembles [Multimodel Global (MMG)]. Several deterministic models are also evaluated, such as the Global Forecast System (GFSdet), Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting Model (HWRF), the deterministic ECMWF model (ECdet), and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamical Laboratory model (GFDL).The ECdet track errors are the smallest on average at all lead times, but are not significantly different from the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means. All models have a slow bias (90–240 km) in the along-track direction by 120 h, while there is little bias in the cross-track direction. Much of this slow bias is attributed to TCs undergoing extratropical transition (ET). All EPSs are underdispersed in the along-track direction, while the ECMWF is slightly overdispersed in the cross-track direction. The MMG and ECMWF track forecasts have more probabilistic skill than the ECdet and comparable skill to the NHC climatology-based cone forecast. TC intensity errors for the HWRF and GFDL are lower than the coarser models within the first 24 h, but are comparable to the ECdet at longer lead times. The ECMWF and MMG have comparable or better probabilistic intensity forecasts than the ECdet, while the GEFS’s weak bias limits its skill.
