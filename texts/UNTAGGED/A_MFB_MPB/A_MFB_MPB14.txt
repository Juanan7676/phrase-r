Estuarine sediments can be a source of Phosphorus (P) to coastal waters, contributing to nutrient budgets and geochemical cycles. In this work, the concentration and speciation of P in 47 cores were examined from the inter-tidal mud flats of the tidal river Thames (~ 120 km). Results of P concentration and speciation were combined with published data relating to known sediment dynamics and water chemistry (salinity) within the estuary to produce a conceptual model of sediment-P behaviour. Results demonstrated significant P desorption occurring after sediment passed through the Estuarine Turbidity Maximum and when the salinity of the river water exceeded ~ 6 ppt. It was found that organic P was desorbed to a greater extent than inorganic P in the lower estuary. Models were used to identify those geochemical parameters that contributed to the Total P (R2 = 0.80), oxalate extractable P (R2 = 0.80) and inorganic P (R2 = 0.76) concentrations within the Thames estuary.
