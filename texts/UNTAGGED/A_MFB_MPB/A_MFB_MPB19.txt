In order to study the pollution levels and spatiotemporal trend of Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) in the Southern Yellow Sea (SYS), thirty-two surface sediment samples and a sediment core have been analyzed, and our results have been compared with previous reports. DDTs contents in our samples ranged from below detection limit to 5.1 ng/g dry weight (d.w.), which presented lower ecological risks in the SYS. Surface sediment results show a seaward increasing trend with high values in the northern region of the central basin of the SYS. Our reconstructed core record and historical data from previous reports reveal an increasing trend from 1905 to 1955 but a decline trend since 1985 for DDTs, which is consistent of the production, usage and banning of DDTs in China. The source identification, based on (DDE + DDD) / DDTs, suggested that aged DDTs were the major contributor, though there were some inputs of fresh DDTs from the usage of 1,1-bis(p-Chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethanol (dicofol).
