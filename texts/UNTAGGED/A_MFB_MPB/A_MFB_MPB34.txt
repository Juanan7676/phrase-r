The response of oyster (Crassostrea virginica) hemocytes was studied following exposure to anatase nanoparticles (ca. 7.4 nm), surface-coated rutile nanocomposites (UV–Titan M212, ca. 86 nm) and bulk titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles (anatase and rutile crystalline forms; ca. 2–5 ?m). Hemocytes were collected from oysters and exposed to one of the four particle types at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/L under dark and environmentally-relevant light conditions for periods of two and four hours. Hemocyte mortality, phagocytosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were then evaluated using flow-cytometric assays. Bulk and nanoparticulate TiO2 had little effect on viability of oyster hemocytes or on production of ROS. Significant changes in phagocytosis occurred after exposure to anatase nanoparticles for 4 h under dark conditions, and UV–Titan for 2 h under light conditions. Results demonstrate that TiO2 particles (bulk or nanoscale) produce minimal effects on hemocyte biomarkers examined following acute, in vitro exposures.
