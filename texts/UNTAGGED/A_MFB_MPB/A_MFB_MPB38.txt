This study determines uptake and accumulation of radionuclides and heavy metals by Pluchea indica and Avicennia marina and evaluates phytoremediation potential via greenhouse and field experiments. P. indica and A. marina are considered excluders for 40K and 262Ra, and Pb since roots accumulated them in higher quantities compared to other plant parts, and the bioconcentration factor (BCF) and transfer factor (TF) values for Pb, and 40K and 262Ra were > 1, respectively. Absorbed dose rate in air (D) showed significant values in sediments, which were generally over the maximum recommended value of 55 nGy h? 1. Phytostabilization of radionuclides and heavy metals may serve as an appropriate strategy for mangrove-polluted areas. D values in sediments were considered sufficiently high to recommend long-term monitoring. Radionuclide activities may increase in the food chain via uptake and accumulation of edible plants, ultimately resulting in harm to human health.
