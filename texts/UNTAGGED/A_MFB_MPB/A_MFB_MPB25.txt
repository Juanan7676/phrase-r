Six campaigns were performed in North Channel (CNOR), Barcas Channel (BC) and lower zones (EZ) of Tagus estuary to better understand methylmercury (MMHg) and mercury (Hg) transport and fate. Highest concentrations of particulate and dissolved MMHg were observed in CNOR in bottom waters and in the warmest months. The MMHg distribution coefficients between particulate and dissolved fractions were mainly influenced by particulate matter and dissolved organic carbon. The values were slightly higher in summer than in winter and in CNOR. Overall, results established that the tidal effect is a main driver on the transport and fate of Hg and MMHg from CNOR to outer areas, evidenced by the exportation of the Hg species from CNOR to the upstream station in high tide and to the downstream one in low tide. Therefore, CNOR may be considered a source of Hg and MMHg to the outer estuary.
