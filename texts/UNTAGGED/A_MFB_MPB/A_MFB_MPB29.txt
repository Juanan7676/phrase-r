The Cananéia-Iguape system is located in a coastal region of southeastern Brazil, recognized by UNESCO as an Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve. This system has suffered substantial environmental impacts due to the opening of an artificial channel and by past intensive mining activities. In this paper was performed the sequential chemical extraction of Cu, Pb, and Zn, on previously described sediment cores, and the statistical treatment of the data, allowing to estimate the remobilization geochemical behavior, the available content and the trend of accumulation between 1926 and 2008. The maximum available level (sum of all mobile fraction) were, in mg kg? 1, 18.74 for Cu, 177.55 for Pb and 123.03 for Zn. Considering its environmental availability, Pb remains a concern in the system. It was possible to recognize the anthropic contribution of Pb, being the mining activities considered the only potential source of this metal in the region.
