The fabrication of the materials with special wettability being capable of removing oil layer on water surface and oil droplets in oil-in-water emulsion is an important issue for water pollution. So far, it still remains challenging to explore a simple, facile, environmentally friendly approach for achieving this goal. Herein, inspired by the adhesion of marine mussels, the polydopamine (PDA) coating with hierarchical structure was directly fabricated onto the surface of melamine (MF) sponge by facile self-polymerization in dopamine solution. Then, a superhydrophobic and superoleophilic sponge was successfully obtained after the modification by dodecanethiol (DDT) at ambient temperature. The as-prepared sponge can selectively separate a series of oil droplets in oil-in-water emulsion with high efficiency (transparency: 76.6–93.8%) and absorb various oils or organic solvents up to 45.2–98.6 times of its own weight. Moreover, in conjunction with a vacuum system, great amounts of oils up to 20 times its own weight can be effectively separated from water surface within 1 s by the sponge. Due to low cost, simple process, and easy accessibility, the as-prepared sponge has potential applications in oil-in-water emulsion separation and oil spill cleanup.
