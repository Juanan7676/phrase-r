Anionic redox plays an important role in obtaining high capacities in lithium-rich layered oxide cathodes. Previous studies on anionic redox and related electronic- and geometric-structure issues, as well as problems induced by anionic-redox and suitable characterization techniques, are reviewed, in order to direct future work on high-capacity electrodes that utilize anionic redox processes and widen the scope of these materials
