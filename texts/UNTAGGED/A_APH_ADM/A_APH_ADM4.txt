Defects in carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts for the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) and various defects in metal oxide/selenide for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) are reviewed. The existence of defects has a great effect on the properties of catalysts; for example, the charge distribution and the conductibility. The strategies to generate defects, the defect–activity relationship, and the techniques to identify defects are discussed
