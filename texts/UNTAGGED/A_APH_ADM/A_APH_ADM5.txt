Hierarchically porous micro-/nanostructuresare favorable for enhancing the electrochemical performance of energy conversion and storage devices. Hierarchically porous micro-/nanostructures produced by the morphology-conserved transformations of various metal-based precursors are summarized, and their applications as electrodes and/or catalysts in rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, and solar cells, are systematically discussed.
