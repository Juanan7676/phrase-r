A series of novel next-generation batteries are demonstrated in this special issue, which arose from the 2016 International Symposium on Next-Generation Batteries, which was organized by Shu-Lei Chou and co-workers, Institute for Superconducting & Electronic Materials (ISEM), University of Wollongong (UOW). The research interest mainly includes lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries, lithium–air batteries, sodium–air batteries, aluminum-ion batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors. These energy-storage systems are expected to electrify our future society in terms of electric vehicles, stationary batteries, and electric aircraft
