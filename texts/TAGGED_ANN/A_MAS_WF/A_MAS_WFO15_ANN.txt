<aim3>This study is an aviation-based application of NOAA’s second-generation medium-range Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast (GEFS/R; i.e., hindcast or retrospective forecast) dataset</aim3>. <meth>The study produced a downscaled probabilistic prediction of instrument flight conditions at major U.S. airports using an analog approach </meth>. <concl>This represents an initial step toward applications of reforecast data to probabilistic aviation decision support services </concl>. <concl>Results from this study show that even at the very coarse resolution of the GEFS/R dataset, the analog approach yielded skillful probabilistic forecasts of flight conditions (i.e., instrument flight rules vs visual flight rules) at most of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)’s Core 30 airports </concl>. <analy>This was particularly true over the central and eastern United States, including the important Golden Triangle, where aircraft flow affects traffic flow management across the entire national airspace system</analy>. <concl>Additionally, the results suggest that reforecast systems utilizing better horizontal and vertical resolution, in both the modeling system and the reforecast archive, would be very useful for aviation forecasting applications </concl>
