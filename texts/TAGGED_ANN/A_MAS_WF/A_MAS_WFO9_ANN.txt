<state>Since 2007, meteorologists of the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah, have relied on a mesoscale ensemble prediction system (EPS) known as the Ensemble Four-Dimensional Weather System (E-4DWX) </state>. <aim>This article describes E-4DWX and the innovative way in which it is calibrated, how it performs, why it was developed, and how meteorologists at DPG use it </aim>. <state>E-4DWX has 30 operational members, each configured to produce forecasts of 48 h every 6 h on a 272-processor high performance computer (HPC) at DPG </state> <state>The ensemble’s members differ from one another in initial-, lateral-, and lower-boundary conditions; in methods of data assimilation; and in physical parameterizations </state>. <meth>The predictive core of all members is the Advanced Research core of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model </meth>. <meth>Numerical predictions of the most useful near-surface variables are dynamically calibrated through algorithms that combine logistic regression and quantile regression, generating statistically realistic probabilistic depictions of the atmosphere’s future state at DPG’s observing sites </meth>. <concl>Army meteorologists view E-4DWX’s output via customized figures posted to a restricted website </concl>. <concl>Some of these figures summarize collective results—for example, through means, standard deviations, or fractions of the ensemble exceeding thresholds </concl>. <concl>Other figures show each forecast, individually or grouped—for example, through spaghetti diagrams and time series <concl>. <aim>This article presents examples of each type of figure </aim>.
