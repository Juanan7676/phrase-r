<state>Coastal regions are increasingly vulnerable to damage from storm surge and inundation </state>. <state>Delft3D is used by the Naval Oceanographic Office to model the ocean dynamics in the near shore </state>. <aim>In this study, the performance of Delft3D in predicting the surge and inundation during Hurricane Ike, which impacted the northern Gulf of Mexico in September 2008, is examined </aim>. <meth2>Wave height, water level, and high-water mark comparisons with a number of observations confirm that the model does well in predicting the surge and inundation during extreme events </meth2>. <meth2>The impact of using forecast winds based on the best-track data as opposed to hindcast winds is also investigated, and it is found that the extent of inundation is represented reasonably well with the forecast winds </meth2>. <analy>In Delft3D, waves can be coupled to the hydrodynamic component using the radiation stress gradient method or the dissipation method </analy>. <concl>Comparing the results of using the two shows that for low-resolution grids such as that needed for a forecast model the dissipation method works better at reproducing the water levels and inundation </concl>.
