<aim>In this paper, probabilistic wind speed forecasts are constructed based on ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecasts for both wind speed and wind direction </aim>. <meth>Including other NWP variables in addition to the one subject to forecasting is common for statistical calibration of deterministic forecasts </meth>. <state>However, this practice is rarely seen for ensemble forecasts, probably because of a lack of methods </state>. <meth>A Bayesian modeling approach (BMA) is adopted, and a flexible model class based on splines is introduced for the mean model </meth>. <meth>The spline model allows both wind speed and wind direction to be included nonlinearly </meth>. <meth>The proposed methodology is tested for forecasting hourly maximum 10-min wind speeds based on ensemble forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts at 204 locations in Norway for lead times from +12 to +108 h </meth>. <concl>An improvement in the continuous ranked probability score is seen for approximately 85% of the locations using the proposed method compared to standard BMA based on only wind speed forecasts </concl>. <concl>For moderate-to-strong wind the improvement is substantial, while for low wind speeds there is generally less or no improvement </concl>. <concl>On average, the improvement is 5% <concl>. <concl>The proposed methodology can be extended to include more NWP variables in the calibration and can also be applied to other variables </concl>.
