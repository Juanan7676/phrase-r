<state>What is the benefit of a near-convection-resolving ensemble over a near-convection-resolving deterministic forecast?</state> <aim3>In this paper, a way in which ensemble and deterministic numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems can be compared is demonstrated using a probabilistic verification framework </aim3>. <meth>Three years’ worth of raw forecasts from the Met Office Unified Model (UM) 12-member 2.2-km Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System (MOGREPS-UK) ensemble and 1.5-km Met Office U.K. variable resolution (UKV) deterministic configuration were compared, utilizing a range of forecast neighborhood sizes centered on surface synoptic observing site locations </meth>. <meth>Six surface variables were evaluated: temperature, 10-m wind speed, visibility, cloud-base height, total cloud amount, and hourly precipitation </meth>. <concl>Deterministic forecasts benefit more from the application of neighborhoods, though ensemble forecast skill can also be improved </concl>. <concl>This confirms that while neighborhoods can enhance skill by sampling more of the forecast, a single deterministic model state in time cannot provide the variability, especially at the kilometer scale, where rapid error growth acts to limit local predictability </concl>. <concl>Ensembles are able to account for the uncertainty at larger, synoptic scales </concl>. <concl>The results also show that the rate of decrease in skill with lead time is greater for the deterministic UKV </concl>. <concl>MOGREPS-UK retains higher skill for longer </concl>. <meth>The concept of a skill differential is introduced to find the smallest neighborhood size at which the deterministic and ensemble scores are comparable </meth>. <concl>This was found to be 3 × 3 (6.6 km) for MOGREPS-UK and 11 × 11 (16.5 km) for UKV </concl>. <concl>Comparable scores are between 2% and 40% higher for MOGREPS-UK, depending on the variable</concl>. <concl>Naively, this would also suggest that an extra 10 km in spatial accuracy is gained by using a kilometer-scale ensemble </concl>.
