<state>Statistical seasonal prediction of tropical cyclones (TCs) has been ongoing for quite some time in many different ocean basins across the world </state>. <state>While a few basins (e.g., North Atlantic and western North Pacific) have been extensively studied and forecasted for many years, Southern Hemispheric TCs have been less frequently studied and generally grouped as a whole or into two primary basins: southern Indian Ocean and Australian </state>. <aim>This paper investigates the predictability of TCs in the northwest Australian (NWAUS) basin of the southeast Indian Ocean (105°–135°E) and describes two statistical approaches to the seasonal prediction of TC frequency, TC days, and accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) </aim>. <meth>The first approach is a traditional deterministic seasonal prediction using predictors identified from NCEP–NCAR reanalysis fields using multiple linear regression </meth>. <aim>The second is a 100-member statistical ensemble approach with the same predictors as the deterministic model but with a resampling of the dataset with replacement and smearing input values to generate slightly different coefficients in the multiple linear regression prediction equations </meth>. <concl>Both the deterministic and ensemble schemes provide valuable forecasts that are better than climatological forecasts </concl>. <concl>The ensemble approach outperforms the deterministic model as well as adding quantitative uncertainty that reflects the predictability of a given TC season</concl>
