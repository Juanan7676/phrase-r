<state>Recent studies document a polarimetric radar signature of refreezing </state>. <state>The signature is characterized by a low-level enhancement in differential reflectivity ZDR and a decrease in the copolar correlation coefficient ρhv within a region of decreasing radar reflectivity factor at horizontal polarization ZH toward the ground, called the refreezing layer (RFL) </state>. <aim3>The evolution of the signature is examined during three winter storms in which the surface precipitation-type transitions from ice pellets to freezing rain </aim3>. <meth>A modified quasi-vertical profile (QVP) technique is developed, which creates inverse-distance-weighted profiles using all available polarimetric data within a specified range from the radar location </meth>. <analy>Using this new technique reveals that the RFL descends in time prior to the transition from ice pellets to freezing rain and intersects the ground at the approximate transition time </analy>. <meth>Transition times are estimated using both crowdsourced and automated precipitation-type reports within a specified domain around the radar </meth>. <meth>These radar-estimated transition times are compared to a recently developed precipitation-classification algorithm based on Rapid Refresh (RAP) model wet-bulb temperature Tw profiles to explore potential benefits of analyzing QVPs during transition events </meth>. <analy>The descent of the RFL in the cases analyzed herein is related to low-level warm-air advection (WAA) </analy>. <meth>A simple method for forecasting the transition time using QVPs is presented for cases of constant WAA </meth>. <concl>The repeatability of the refreezing signature’s descent in ice pellet to freezing rain transition events suggests the potential for its use in operational settings to create or modify short-term forecasts </concl>.
