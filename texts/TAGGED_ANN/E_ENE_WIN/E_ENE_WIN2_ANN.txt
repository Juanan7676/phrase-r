<aim>Dynamics of a wind turbine blade under bend-bend-twist coupled vibrations is investigated </aim>. <meth>The potential and kinetic energy expressions for a straight nonuniform blade are written in terms of beam parameters </meth>. <meth>Then, the energies are expressed in terms of modal coordinates by using the assumed mode method, and the equations of motion are found by applying Lagrange's formula </meth/. <meth>The bend-bend-twist equations are coupled with each other and have stiffness variations due to centrifugal effects and gravitational parametric terms, which vary cyclicly with the hub angle </meth>. <meth>To determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the system, a modal analysis is applied on the linearized coupled equations of constant angle snapshots of a blade with effects of constant speed rotation </meth>. <meth>Lower modes of the coupled bend-bend-twist model are dominantly in-plane or out-of-plane modes </meth>. <meth>To investigate the parametric effects, several blade models are analyzed at different angular positions </meth>. <analy>The stiffness terms involving centrifugal and gravitational effects can be significant for long blades </analy>. <meth>To further see the effect of blade length on relative parametric stiffness change, the blade models are scaled in size and analyzed at constant rotational speeds, at horizontal and vertical orientations </meth>. <concl>These studies show that the parametric stiffness effects should be taken into account when designing long blades </concl>.
