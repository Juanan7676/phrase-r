<meth>An active grid is used to generate a variety of turbulent shear profiles in a wind tunnel </meth>. <meth>The vertical bars are set to flap through varying angles across the test section producing a variation in the perceived solidity, resulting in a mean shear </meth>. <meth>The horizontal bars are used in a fully random operational mode to set the background turbulence level </meth>. <concl>It is demonstrated that mean velocity profiles with approximately the same shear can be produced with different turbulence intensities and local turbulent Reynolds numbers based on the Taylor microscale, λ </concl>. <concl>Conversely, it is also demonstrated that flows can be produced with similar turbulence intensity profiles but different mean shear </concl>. <concl>It is confirmed that the length scales and dynamics, the latter being assessed through the velocity spectra and probability density functions, do not vary significantly across the investigation domain </concl>. <state>Such flows are of particular relevance for studies investigating the effect of in-flow conditions on obstacles where these studies wish to decouple the effects of turbulence intensity and mean shear, a feat previously unattainable in experimental facilities </state>. <analy>Given that the power output of wind turbines is known to be a function of both mean shear and turbulence intensity, the experimental methodology presented herein is invaluable to the wind turbine model testing community who, at present, cannot exert such control authority over the in-flow conditions </analy>.
