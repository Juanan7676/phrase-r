<state>Forecasts of available wind power are critical in key electric power systems operations planning problems, including economic dispatch and unit commitment </state>. <state>Such forecasts are necessarily uncertain, limiting the reliability and cost-effectiveness of operations planning models based on a single deterministic or “point” forecast </state>. <meth>A common approach to address this limitation involves the use of a number of probabilistic scenarios, each specifying a possible trajectory of wind power production, with associated probability </meth>. <aim3>We present and analyze a novel method for generating probabilistic wind power scenarios, leveraging available historical information in the form of forecasted and corresponding observed wind power time series </aim3>. <meth>We estimate nonparametric forecast error densities, specifically using epi-spline basis functions, allowing us to capture the skewed and nonparametric nature of error densities observed in real-world data </meth>. <meth>We then describe a method to generate probabilistic scenarios from these basis functions that allows users to control for the degree to which extreme errors are captured </meth>. <meth>We compare the performance of our approach to the current state-of-the-art considering publicly available data associated with the Bonneville Power Administration, analyzing aggregate production of a number of wind farms over a large geographic region </meth>. <meth>Finally, we discuss the advantages of our approach in the context of specific power systems operations planning problems: stochastic unit commitment and economic dispatch </meth>. <meth>Our methodology is embodied in the joint Sandia–University of California Davis Prescient software package for assessing and analyzing stochastic operations strategies </meth>.
