<aim>The paper discusses the complexity of calibration of strain gage full bridges applied to measure mechanical loads in large wind turbines, when direct application of calibration loads is not feasible </aim>. <aim3>In particular, at first, it presents a generalized static-dynamic mechanical model which allows to calibrate the strain gage full bridges using its own unbalanced masses to generate known reference inputs</aim3>. <aim3>Then, the paper discusses the uncertainty associated to such a calibration, according to the ISO/IEC Guide 98-3:2008 “Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement” </aim3>. <aim>The uncertainty of the reference input and the following calibration is discussed, which is often larger than the target set by the standard IEC-61400-13 used for wind turbine type certification </aim>. <analy>The paper comments on the attainable range of calibration which is rather limited with respect to expected load range in operation </analy>. <analy>Even if calibration should take place in isothermal effects, this is not always the case in real world practice </analy>. <concl>Therefore, the thermal effects on strain gage bridges are also discussed, putting into evidence its influence on calibration uncertainty both for full bridges in T configuration and in parallel configuration </concl>.
