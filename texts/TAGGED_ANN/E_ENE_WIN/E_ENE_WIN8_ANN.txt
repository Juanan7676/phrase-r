<meth>Large eddy simulations (LES) of the flow past a wind turbine with and without tower and nacelle have been performed at 2 tip speed ratios (TSR,  ), λ=3 and 6, where the latter corresponds to design conditions </meth>. <meth>The turbine model is placed in a virtual wind tunnel to reproduce the “Blind test 1” experiment performed at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) closed-loop wind tunnel </meth>. The wind turbine was modeled using the actuator line model for the rotor blades and the immersed boundary method for the tower and nacelle. <aim>The aim of the paper is to highlight the impact of tower and nacelle on the turbine wake </aim>. <meth>Therefore, a second set of simulations with the rotating blades only (neglecting the tower and nacelle) has been performed as reference </meth>. <meth>Present results are compared with the experimental measurements made at NTNU and numerical simulations available in the literature </meth>. <analy>The tower and nacelle not only produce a velocity deficit in the wake but they also affect the turbulent kinetic energy and the fluxes </analy>. <analy>The wake of the tower interacts with that generated by the turbine blades promoting the breakdown of the tip vortex and increasing the mean kinetic energy flux into the wake </analy>. <concl>When tower and nacelle are modeled in the numerical simulations, results improve significantly both in the near wake and in the far wake </concl>.
