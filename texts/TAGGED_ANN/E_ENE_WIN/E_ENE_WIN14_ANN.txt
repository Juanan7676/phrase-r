<aim3>The induction zone in front of different wind turbine rotors is studied by means of steady-state Navier-Stokes simulations combined with an actuator disk approach </aim3>. <analy>It is shown that, for distances beyond 1 rotor radius upstream of the rotors, the induced velocity is self-similar and independent of the rotor geometry </analy>. <concl>On the basis of these findings, a simple analytical model of the induction zone of wind turbines is proposed </concl>.
