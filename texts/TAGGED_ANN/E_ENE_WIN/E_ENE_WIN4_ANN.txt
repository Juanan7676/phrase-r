<aim3>Wind resource assessments are used to estimate a wind farm's power production during the planning process </aim3>. <aim2>It is important that these estimates are accurate, as they can impact financing agreements, transmission planning, and environmental targets </aim2>. <aim>Here, we analyze the challenges in wind power estimation for onshore farms </aim>. <intr>Turbine wake effects are a strong determinant of farm power production </intr>. <state>With given input wind conditions, wake losses typically cause downstream turbines to produce significantly less power than upstream turbines </state>. <meth>These losses have been modeled extensively and are well understood under certain conditions </meth>. <meth>Most notably, validation of different model types has favored offshore farms </meth>. <state>Models that capture the dynamics of offshore wind conditions do not necessarily perform equally as well for onshore wind farms </state>. <meth>We analyze the capabilities of several different methods for estimating wind farm power production in 2 onshore farms with non-uniform layouts </meth>. <meth>We compare the Jensen model to a number of statistical models, to meteorological downscaling techniques, and to using no model at all </meth>. <concl>We show that the complexities of some onshore farms result in wind conditions that are not accurately modeled by the Jensen wake decay techniques and that statistical methods have some strong advantages in practice </concl>.
