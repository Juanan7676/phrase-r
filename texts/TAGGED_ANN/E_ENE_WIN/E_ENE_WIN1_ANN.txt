<mot>Two bladed wind turbines are discussed as a possible turbine alternative for offshore use as they show a potential to save cost of energy </mot>. <state>But compared to three-bladed turbines, their dynamic behavior is much more challenging </state>. <meth>A possible solution to handle these larger dynamic loads is the use of a teeter hinge, which can significantly reduce fatigue loads </meth>. <state>In contrast to that, extreme loads, coming from teeter end impacts, are often described as a problem for teetered turbines </state>. <state>There are different design parameters of the teeter system of a turbine, which have an influence on extreme loads during teeter end impacts </state>. <state>Despite numerous studies on teeter movement and load reduction potentials of operational loads, scientific literature does not give information about suitable load-reducing combinations of teeter design parameters and their influence on extreme loads </state>. <aim>This paper, which is a summary of a PhD thesis,[1] analyses which combination of teeter parameters has the largest load-reducing influence on extreme loads </aim>. <meth>Aeroelastic load simulations of the teetered turbine CART2 from the NREL test site and one of today's commercial two-bladed turbines, the SCD3MW from aerodyn (both pitch controlled upwind turbines), will be used </meth>.
