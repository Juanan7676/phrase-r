<state>Mitigating loads on a wind turbine rotor can reduce the cost of energy </state>. <state>Sweeping blades produces a structural coupling between flapwise bending and torsion, which can be used for load alleviation purposes </state>. <aim>A multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) problem is formulated including the blade sweep as a design variable </aim>. <meth> A multifidelity approach is used to confront the crucial effects of structural coupling on the estimation of the loads </meth>. <meth>During the MDO, ultimate and damage equivalent loads are estimated using steady-state and frequency-domain–based models, respectively </meth>. <meth>The final designs are verified against time-domain full design load basis aeroelastic simulations to ensure that they comply with the constraints </meth>. <meth>A 10-MW wind turbine blade is optimized by minimizing a cost function that includes mass and blade root flapwise fatigue loading </meth>. <meth>The design space is subjected to constraints that represent all the necessary requirements for standard design of wind turbines </meth>. <meth>Simultaneous aerodynamic and structural optimization is performed with and without sweep as a design variable </meth>. <analy>When sweep is included in the MDO process, further minimization of the cost function can be obtained <analy>. <meth>To show this achievement, a set of optimized straight blade designs is compared to a set of optimized swept blade designs </meth>. <concl>Relative to the respective optimized straight designs, the blade mass of the swept blades is reduced of an extra 2% to 3% and the blade root flapwise fatigue damage equivalent load by a further 8% </concl>.
