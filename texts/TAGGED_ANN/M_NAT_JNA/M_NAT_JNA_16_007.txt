Arctic shipping routes attract more and more attention because of the increasing possibility to build commercial shipping routes which connect East Asia and Western Europe. To build profitable commercial shipping routes, shipping companies should study many issues about the Arctic carefully since it is a new and unfamiliar frontier. To find out key factors influencing the building of Arctic shipping routes, the authors applied the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model in this study. Based on the AHP experts’ questionnaires, we applied the fuzzy AHP model to analyse the opinions of respondents. This article presents the results of an empirical survey conducted among shipping companies and academic researchers with ship captain experience to explore their attitudes toward the building of Arctic shipping routes. The findings showed that: ‘Safety and risk’ is the most important aspect affecting the building of Arctic shipping routes and in order of relative importance, the top six critical assessment factors are ‘navigation safety and risk analysis,’ ‘governance and cooperation,’ ‘navigation information,’ ‘cargo sources,’ ‘cost,’ and ‘navigator ability,’ respectively.
