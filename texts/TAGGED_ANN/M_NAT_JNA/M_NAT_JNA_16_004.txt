Adaptive Information Systems (AdIS) are systems responsive to environmental changes or changes in a ship's systems. In this paper the potential of shipboard AdIS to decrease an officer's excessive workload are examined. The workload of the Officer Of the Watch (OOW) consists of tasks being initiated by the OOW and by external inputs. Sometimes the external inputs, particularly those requiring low priority actions, actually distract the OOW and increase the workload. Consequently an overload may be reduced by delaying low priority information, thus delaying the actions they could initiate. To estimate the applicability of AdIS, a model has been developed using a discrete event simulation software, consisting of three main modules: environment, AdIS and the OOW. The simulation has been run with a traffic environment comparable to those existing in the Dover Strait. A comparison between the OOW workload with and without AdIS has been estimated, indicating that during demanding navigation AdIS can significantly reduce the overload time. In areas similar to the Dover Strait the overload time can be reduced by a third.
