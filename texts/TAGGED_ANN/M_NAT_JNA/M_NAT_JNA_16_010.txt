Course keeping for ships is the core of automatic navigation in sea transportation. Much work has concentrated on developing novel control strategies for closed loop systems. We have turned our attention the other way to improve the control performance of marine autopilots in this work by “modulating” the control error using a sine function while the construction of the controller is not changed. The nonlinear feedback signal thus obtained is sent to the controller to replace the control error itself, which used to be the deviation between the output response and the reference input of the system. Such a control scheme is called “nonlinear feedback control” hereafter. Theoretical analysis by using a describing function and robust control theory shows that the same control quality is guaranteed with minor control actions for the nonlinear feedback scheme. Simulation experiments were carried out for the ship Yulong of Dalian Maritime University. It is shown that the method postulated in this paper has advantages of safety and energy saving in navigation; the maximum initial rudder angle is reduced by 31·2% with satisfactory control effect.
