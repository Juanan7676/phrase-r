<aim>Benthic video surveys were carried out at two marine finfish aquaculture and associated reference sites in Jervis Inlet (JI), British Columbia </aim>. <meth>Substrate composition, epifaunal diversity, mat-forming taxa (primary indicators: opportunistic polychaete complexes (OPCs) and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria) and waste pellets were quantitatively assessed </meth>. <analy>Hard-bottom substrates were dominated by rock wall, skeletal sponge matrix, graded bedrock, rock-veneer, and cobble</analy>. <meth>Aquaculture waste outputs (modelled depositional carbon fluxes and observations of waste feed/faecal pellets) were correlated with benthic organic enrichment indicators (OPC and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria) </meth>. <analy>Sulfide-oxidizing bacteria varied in abundance up to a modelled depositional carbon flux of ~ 2 gC m? 2 day? 1 where it sustained 50% areal coverage </analy>. <analy>Glass sponges revealed an inverse relationship with aquaculture waste outputs and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria</analy>. <analy>Plumose anemones and shrimp showed a low frequency of occurrence at reference sites; however, they were abundant within the near-field zone of the aquaculture sites associated with a higher modelled carbon flux </analy>. <concl>Future research should focus on the response of various taxa to depositional gradients and their potential role as secondary indicators of aquaculture activities associated with rock-cliff communities </concl>.
