<state>Bioluminescent seas caused by blooms of the dinoflagellate Noctiluca scintillans are a famous scenic attraction in the Matsu archipelago near the Chinese coast in the northern part of the Taiwan Strait </state>. <aim>The relationship between the abundance of N. scintillans and various environmental factors was examined in the subtropical coastal waters of these islands from April to December, 2016</aim>. <concl>N. scintillans disappeared after June 20th, when the sea water temperature exceeded 27 °C </concl>. <concl>A strong inverse correlation between N. scintillans and diatoms in PCA analysis indicated that diatoms suffer high grazing pressure from N. scintillans </concl>. <analy>N. scintillans appeared most abundantly during the flood season, when diatoms are most abundant </analy>. <concl>Strong inverse correlations between N. scintillans and the wind speed and wind direction in PCA further point to the effect of wind on the accumulation of cells </concl>.
