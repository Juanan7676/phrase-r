<state>Chilean waters are often affected by Alexandrium catenella, one of the leading organisms behind Harmful Algae Blooms (HABs) </state>. <meth>Genetic variability for this species are commonly carried out from cultured samples, approach that may not accurately quantify genetic variability of this organism in the water column </meth>. <aim3>In this study, genetic variability of A. catenella was determined by sequencing the rDNA region, in water samples from the Canal Puyuhuapi (South Austral Ecosystem of Chile) </aim3>. <analy>A. catenella was detected in 8,8% of samples analysed </analy>. <analy>All sequences obtained were A. catenella (Tamara complex group I), with three highly frequent haplotypes (34%), and twenty new haplotypes </analy>. <concl>These haplotypes increase the genetic variability from 2.8% to 3.14% in this area</concl>. <meth2>Through this new method, genetic determination of A. catenella can accurately be monitored and ecological studies of this species can be implemented </meth2>.
