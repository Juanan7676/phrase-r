<aim>Endocrine disrupting potentials were assessed for sediment samples collected near Hebei Spirit oil spill (HSOS) site, between December 2007 and January 2012 <aim>. <aim3>For comparison, major crude oil (CO) of HSOS, or its weathered form were assessed </aim3>. <meth>Both raw extracts (REs) and their fractionated samples were tested using H295R and MVLNluc bioassays </meth>. <analy>In H295R cells, REs of crude and weathered oil (WO), and nine of 14 sediments significantly increased E2 levels, which were correlated with the concentrations of PAHs </analy>. <analy>Steroidogenic disruption potentials of the sediments generally decreased over time </analy>. <analy>Among silica fractions of all REs, aromatic hydrocarbons (F2) and polar compounds (F3) caused greater E2 levels </analy>. <analy>While, in MVLN cell bioassay, only three of 14 sediment REs showed estrogen receptor binding potencies, and no temporal trend was observed </analy>. <concl>In conclusion, oil spill can cause endocrine disruption in the affected ecosystem through steroidogenic alteration for years, and such potencies attenuate over time </concl>.
