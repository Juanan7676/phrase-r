<state>In the shipping industry, it is well known that around 80 % or more of all marine accidents are caused fully or at least in part by human error </state>. <state>In this regard, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) stated that the study of human factors would be important for improving maritime safety</state>. <aim2>Consequently, the IMO adopted the Casualty Investigation Code, including guidelines to assist investigators in the implementation of the Code, to prevent similar accidents occurring again in the future </aim2>. <aim>In this paper, a process of the human factors investigation is proposed to provide investigators with a guide for determining the occurrence sequence of marine accidents, to identify and classify human error-inducing underlying factors, and to develop safety actions that can manage the risk of marine accidents </aim>. <aim2>Also, an application of these investigation procedures to a collision accident is provided as a case study </aim2>. <aim2>This is done to verify the applicability of the proposed human factors investigation procedures </aim2>. <meth>The proposed human factors investigation process provides a systematic approach and consists of 3 steps: ‘Step 1: collect data & determine occurrence sequence’ using the SHEL model and the cognitive process model; ‘Step 2: identify and classify underlying human factors’ using the Maritime-Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (M-HFACS) model; and ‘Step 3: develop safety actions,’ using the causal chains </meth>. <concl>The case study shows that the proposed human factors investigation process is capable of identifying the underlying factors and indeveloping safety actions to prevent similar accidents from occurring </concl>.
