<state>As container vessels get larger, container terminals are also likely to grow </state>. <intr>The problem that arises is that the growing volume should be handled in the same amount of time as before</intr>. <intr>Container terminals are introducing an automation system in order to overcome the limitations of existing manual methods and to continuously reduce operating expenses </intr>. <state>Because, Manual handling of carrying containers gate in and out of terminals causes inaccurate data, which results in confusion </state>. <meth>An alternative is for containers to be labeled with barcodes that can be scanned into a system with a scanner, but this takes quite a long time and is inconvenient </meth>. <meth>A RFID system, also known as a gate automation system, can solve these problems by reducing the time of gate management with a technology that detects number identification plates, helping operators more efficiently perform gate management work </meth>. <analy>Having said that, with this system, when container damage is detected, gate operators make and keep documents manually </analy>. <analy>These documents, which are insufficient evidence in proving container damage, result in customer claims </analy>. <state>In addition, it is difficult for gate operators and other workers to manage containers, exposing them to danger and accidents </state>. <aim3>This study suggests that if an automation system is introduced at gates, containers can be managed by a video storage system in order to better document damage</aim3> <concl>The video system maintains information on container damage, allowing operators the ability to search for videos they need upon customer request, also allowing them to be better prepared for customer claims </concl>. <concl>In addition, this system reduces necessary personnel and risk of accidents near gates by integrating a wide range of work </concl>.
