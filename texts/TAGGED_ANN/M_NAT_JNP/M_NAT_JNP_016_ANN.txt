<state>Recently, a new port reserves deep water depth for safe navigation and mooring, following the trend of larger ship building </state>. <state>Larger port facilities include long and huge breakwaters, and mainly adopt vertical type considering low construction cost </state>. <state>A vertical breakwater creates stem waves combining inclined incident waves and reflected waves, and this causes maneuvering difficulty to the passing vessels, and erosion of shoreline with additional damages to berthing facilities </state>. <aim3>Thus, in this study, the researchers have investigated the response of stem waves at the vertical breakwater near the entrance channel and applied numerical models, which are commonly used for the analysis of wave response at the harbor design </aim3>. <meth>The basic equation composing models here adopted both the linear parabolic approximation adding the nonlinear dispersion relationship and nonlinear parabolic approximation adding a linear dispersion relationship </meth>. <meth>To analyze the applicability of both models, the research compared the numerical results with the existing hydraulic mod<el results </meth>. <concl>The gap of serial breakwaters and aligned angles caused more complicated stem wave generation and secondary stem wave was found through the breakwater gap </concl>. <concl>Those analyzed results should be applied to ship handling simulation studies at the approaching channels, along with the mooring test </concl>.
