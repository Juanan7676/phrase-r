<state>Port service level is a metric of competitiveness among ports for the operating/managing bodies such as the terminal operation company (TOC), Port Authority, or the government, and is used as an important indicator for shipping companies and freight haulers when selecting a port </state>. <aim>Considering the importance of metrics, we developed software to objectively define and manage six important service indicators exclusive to container and bulk terminals including: berth occupancy rate, ship's waiting ratio, berth throughput, number of berths, average number of vessels waiting, and average waiting time </aim>. <meth>We computed the six service indicators utilizing berth 1 through berth 5 in the container terminals and berth 1 through berth 4 in the bulk terminals </meth>. <analy>The software model allows easy computation of expected ship's waiting ratio over berth occupancy rate, berth throughput, counts of berth, average number of vessels waiting and average waiting time </analy>. <analy>Further, the software allows prediction of yearly throughput by utilizing a ship’s waiting ratio and other productivity indicators and making calculations based on arrival patterns of ship traffic </analy>. <concl>As a result, a TOC is able to make strategic decisions on the trade-offs in the optimal operating level of the facility with better predictors of the service factors (ship’s waiting ratio) and productivity factors (yearly throughput) </concl>. <concl>Successful implementation of the software would attract more shipping companies and shippers and maximize TOC profits </concl>
