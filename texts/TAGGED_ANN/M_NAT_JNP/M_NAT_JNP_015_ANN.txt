<state>Recently, container terminal operators have made efforts to develop an efficient remarshalling plan in response to the increase in automation of equipment handling and transport of containers in the terminals </state>. <state>Usually, containers are handled by multiple AYCs(automated yard cranes) in-yard in an automated container terminal, and terminal operators establish a remarshalling plan using slack time to increase the efficiency of ship operation </state>. <aim3>This study develops the optimal mathematical model through mixed integer programming as a solution to the problem of dispatching multiple AYCs </aim3>. <meth>Considering the difficulty of direct application to the field due to computation time, we analyze the five prototypical dispatching rules for real world adaptation</meth>. <concl>A numerical experiment found that the maximum weight ratio (MR) rule and the maximum weight (MW) rule are the ideal dispatching solutions to the multiple AYCs dispatching problem </concl>.
