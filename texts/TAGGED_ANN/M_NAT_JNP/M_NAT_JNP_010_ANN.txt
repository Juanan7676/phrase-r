<state>In situ capping technology for marine sediment pollution control has never been applied in South Korea </state>. <aim>In this study a pilot project for the capping was carried out in Busan N Harbor </aim>. <meth>Pipeline and clamshell capping technologies were implemented for the pollution control </meth>. <meth>Changes of capping shapes, sediment contamination, and the time and costs required for the two constructions were compared </meth>. <analy>Both the pipeline and clamshell technologies were found to satisfy the target thickness of 50 cm on average </analy>. <analy>However, the pipeline method did not operate sensitively in terms of change of the sea floor topography, resulting in an uneven shape and a thickness </analy>. <analy>Organic carbon and ignition loss quite decreased after the pipeline or the clamshell capping while pH showed no significant change </analy>. <analy>Organic and residual fraction of Cd, Ni, and Zn in the sediments appeared to decrease after all cappings</analy>. <analy>The pipeline method took a construction time four times as much as the clamshell method </analy>. <concl>The clamshell method was demonstrated to reduce the construction cost by about 40% compared with the pipeline method</concl>. <concl>However, a monitoring for all the parameters needs to be conducted at least two years in order to better evaluate an efficiency of the pollution control by these capping constructions </concl>
