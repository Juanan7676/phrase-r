<state>IMO introduced e-Navigation concept to improve the efficiency of ship operation, port operation, and ship navigation technology </state>. <state>IMO proposed sixteen MSPs (Maritime Service Portfolio) applicable to the ships and onshore in case of e-Navigation implementation </state>. <aim>In order to meet the demands of the international society, the system implementation work for the Korean e-Navigation has been specified </aim>. <state>The Korean e-Navigation system has five service categories: the S2 service category, which is a ship anomaly monitoring service, is a service that classifies emergency levels according to the degree of abnormal condition when a ship has an abnormality in ship operation, and provides guidance for emergency situations </state>. <state>The navigation safety module is a sub-module of the S2 service that determines the emergency level in case of navigation equipment malfunctioning, engine or steering gear failure during navigation </state>. <analy>It provides emergency response guidance based on emergency level to the abnormal ship </analy>. <analy>If an abnormal condition occurs during the ship operation, first, the ship shall determine the emergency level, according to the degree of abnormality of the ship </analy>. <analy>Second, an emergency response guidance is generated based on the determined emergency level, and the guidance is transmitted to the ship, which helps the navigators prevent accidents and not to spread </analy>. <aim>In this study, the operational concept for the implementation of the Korean e-Navigation system is designed and the concept is focused on the navigation safety module of S2 service </aim>.
