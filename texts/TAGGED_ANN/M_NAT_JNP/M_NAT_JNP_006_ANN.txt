<intr>The Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) is a structured and systematic methodology developed by the IMO, aimed at assessing the risk of vessels and recommending the method to control intolerable risks, thereby enhancing maritime safety, including protection of life, health, the marine environment and property, by using risk analysis and cost-benefit assessment</intr>. <state>While the FSA has mostly been applied to merchant vessels, it has rarely been applied to a DP vessel, which is one of the special purpose vessels in the offshore industry </state>. <meth>Furthermore, most of the FSA has been conducted so far by using the Fault Tree Analysis tool, even though there are many other risk analysis tools</meth>. <aim3>This study carried out the FSA for safe operation of DP vessels by using the Bayesian network, under which conditional probability was examined</aim3>. <concl>This study determined the frequency and severity of DP LOP incidents reported to the IMCA from 2001 to 2010, and obtained the Risk Index by applying the Bayesian network</concl>. T<meth>hen, the Risk Control Options (RCOs) were identified through an expert brainstorming and DP vessel simulations </meth>. <concl>This study recommends duplication of PRS, regardless of the DP class and PRS type and DP system specific training</concl>. <concl>Finally, this study verified that the Bayesian network and DP simulator can also serve as an effective tool for FSA implementation </concl>.
