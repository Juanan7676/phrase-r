<state>In the offshore crane system, the requirements on the operating safety are extremely high due to many external factors </state>. <state>Rope extension is one of the factors producing vertical vibration of load </state>. <aim>In this study, the load is carried by the motor-winch actuator control and the rope is modeled as a mass-damper-spring system </aim>. <meth>To control the load position and suppress the vertical vibration of the load, a control system based on input-output linearization method is proposed </meth>. <meth2>By the simulation and experiment results with pilot crane model, the effectiveness of proposed control method is evaluated and verified </meth2> .
