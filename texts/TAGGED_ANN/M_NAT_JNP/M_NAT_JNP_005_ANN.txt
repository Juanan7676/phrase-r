<state>Current scenarios for marine spill accidents were developed based on probable maximum spill accidents</state>. <state>However, accidents of similar scale to maximum spill accidents are virtually non-existent, and training or deployment of response equipment based on these scenarios can be cost prohibitive </state>. Current scenarios require realism for practical use and need to be designed for purpose of use. <aim3>In this study we developed scenarios that may replace current scenarios by using the HNS accident standard codes based on past accident cases </aim3>. <meth>Scenarios were developed by modularizing the HNS accident standard code, that is classified into three scenarios: Maximum Frequency Scenario, Maximum Damage Scenario, and Maximum Vulnerability Scenario </meth>. <concl>The situation of an accident presented in each scenario developed in this process is much like a real accident, and therefore, it is practical application </concl>.
