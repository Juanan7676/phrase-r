<state>Many breakwaters were failed due to the geo-disaster caused by the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami </state>. <state>Investigations were carried out, and it was found that the breakwater failed mainly due to the failure of its foundation </state>. <state>However, mechanism of the failure of the breakwater has not yet been completely explained </state>. <aim>This paper focuses on the stability evaluation of a breakwater foundation subjected to an earthquake and a tsunami </aim>. <meth>The main feature of the study is application of centrifuge technique for a geo-disaster caused by an earthquake and a tsunami </meth>. <analy>Results of the study show that in the case of a geo-disaster brought by an earthquake and a tsunami, excessive pore water pressure generated in the sandy ground, and consequently liquefaction occurred during the earthquake </analy>. <concl>That resulted in deformation of the foundation ground and settlement of the breakwater </concl>. <state>During the tsunami, scouring could occur around the harbor side mound, and seepage took place beneath the breakwater </state>. <analy>These were the main reasons of decrease in bearing capacity of the foundation ground and failure of the breakwater </analy>. <meth>Numerical simulations were also performed to make clear the mechanism and behavior of the breakwater under an earthquake and a tsunami </meth>. <concl>Overall, this study can be useful to understand the failure process of a breakwater under an earthquake and a tsunami, and it can be helpful to develop countermeasures in order to reduce the earthquake and tsunami induced damage of a breakwater in the future </concl>.
