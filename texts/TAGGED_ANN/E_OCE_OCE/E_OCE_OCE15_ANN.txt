<aim>This paper focuses on the effect of initial imperfections and corrosion wastage on the age related strength degradation of bulk carriers </aim>. <meth>At the beginning, the initial imperfections including initial distortions and residual stresses, are employed to assess the ultimate bending moment reduction </meth>. <aim>Then, the effect of thickness degradation due to corrosion wastage on the ultimate hull girder strength is investigated </aim>. <aim>Finally, the combination of initial imperfections and corrosion wastage is considered to evaluate the residual hull girder strength </aim>. <meth>To do that, the initial imperfections of the unperfected structures and a corrosion rate estimation model for bulk carriers are introduced </meth>. <meth>A simplified method is also proposed to determine the ultimate vertical bending moment of ship hull girder subjected to initial imperfections and corrosion wastage </meth>. <concl>Additionally, the design and construction considerations for bulk carriers are made </concl>.
