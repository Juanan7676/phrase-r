<state>Robotic systems capable of aquatic movement has increased exploitation in recent years due to the diverse range of missions that can be performed in otherwise hostile environments </state>. <state>These aquatic unmanned vehicles (AUVs) have begun to transition to systems that replicate biological animals as they are already extremely efficient at moving in aqueous environments </state>. <concl>The result is the abandonment of inefficient propeller based locomotion for a biological locomotion type suitable for the specific mission </concl>. <state>There is a diverse range of biological locomotion's available with animals that give a range of criteria to follow </state>. <aim>In this review, existing aquatic animals and found AUVs are classified </aim>. <aim>How the bioinspired systems compare to the animals in their locomotion is investigated and discussed </aim>. <aim>Then, it is discussed what makes these systems bioinspired and biomimetic, and the AUVs that fall into these distinctive categories </aim>. <recom>Limitations and future recommendations on possible improvements for these systems are offered </recom>.
