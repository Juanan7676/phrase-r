<aim>An experimental study of an undulating membrane based on the Eel Energy device is presented in this paper </aim>. <meth>This system uses interaction between a semi-rigid plate and an axial flow to generate undulation </meth>. <meth>At full scale, the deformation of the structure is then converted into electrical power using linear electromagnetic generators </meth>. <meth>In order to simulate the power take-off on a 1/20th scale prototype, hydraulic dampers are located all over the length of the device </meth>. <state>The dampers have non-linear behaviour </state>. <meth>A representative damping parameter have been introduced to study their impact </meth>. <analy>Results are presented in function of fluid velocity and damping adjustment </analy>. <concl>Undulation mode, frequency and forces on the structure are described<concl>. <concl>Results show that fluid velocity has a destabilizing effect on the membrane, increasing undulation frequency and lowering its amplitude, while damping has the opposite effect </concl>. <meth>Furthermore, two methods used to evaluate the power conversion are described and evaluated from trajectory and forces data analysis </meth>. <concl>Power estimation shows an evolution proportional to cubic current speed at low flow speed, as for classical tidal turbines </concl>. <concl>Power also seems to scale with the square of the product between undulation frequency and amplitude </concl>.
