<state>The exploratory frontier of offshore oil and gas industry comes into deeper waters, with the 3000 m water depth barrier hurdled in the US Gulf of Mexico in 2003 </state>. <meth>At these water depths, the extremely high external pressures, low temperatures, long distance tie-backs and high environmental loads due to waves, currents, and wind combined brings the employed equipment to its operational limit </meth>. <aim>This paper presents a literature review on failure events experienced by the industry concerning pipelines, risers, and umbilical cables, describing their causes, consequences, and severity </aim>. <aim>From the several failure modes reported up to now, it is possible to select the ones that are more frequent and deserves attention from academia and industry </aim>. <concl>Concerning pipelines, the main failure modes reported are due to mechanical damage, corrosion, construction defect, natural hazards and fatigue </concl>. <ori> Additionally, a vast review of published researches concerning the pipeline-seabed interaction is presented </ori>. <state>With regard to floating risers, approximately 85% of them are of flexible type </state>. <concl>Although flexible risers may fail in different ways, collapse due to external pressure is reported as the most frequent failure mode </concl>. <concl>For umbilical cables, the major failure modes are found to occur under tension or compression, torsion, fatigue, wear and sheaving </concl>.
