<state>The laying of subsea pipelines often produces situations where the pipeline is suspended above the seabed due to local erosion of sediment </state>. <aim>In this paper, flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder close to a plane boundary in an oscillatory flow is studied through two-dimensional numerical simulations </aim>. <meth>The circular cylinder and the plane boundary represents a pipeline and the seabed, respectively </meth>. <concl>It is found that the plane boundary affects the vibration amplitude in the cross-flow direction significantly </concl>. <analy>The vibration in the vertical direction ceases if reduced velocity exceeds 6 for KC = 5 and 12 for KC = 10, respectively </analy>. <analy>The vibration in the cross-flow direction stops when the reduced velocity exceeds a critical value because the effective KCnumber and the effective reduced velocity, which are both based on the relative velocity of the cylinder to the fluid motion, are extremely small </analy>. <concl>For KC = 10, the vortex shedding is found to be in one pair regime for most of the reduced velocities and non-vortex shedding regime exists at large reduced velocities </concl>. <concl>Because the shear layers generated from the plane boundary attract the vortices generated from the cylinder, vortex shedding occurs only at the bottom side of the cylinder </concl>.
