<intr>The hybrid monopile-friction wheel foundation is an innovative alternative for offshore wind turbines </intr>. <state>The concept has wider adaptability and can be used as reinforcement method for existing monopiles </state>. <meth>A series of centrifuge tests was performed to investigate the lateral bearing capacities of the hybrid foundation under monotonic loads </meth>. <meth>Five foundation models and two soil types were considered </meth>. <analy>According to the recorded responses, the hybrid foundation demonstrated better lateral behaviors that both lateral bearing capacity and stiffness are enhanced </analy>. <meth>Two analytical methods were proposed and compared with the centrifuge test results </meth>. <analy>The bearing capacity of the hybrid foundation is smaller than the sum of individual pile and friction wheel, and a reduction factor is suggested for both friction wheels </analy>. <analy>The friction wheel restrains rotations of monopile and provides extra restoring moments; their effects are idealized as equivalent moments acting on the pile head </analy>. <concl>The analytical results provide possible solutions in estimating the lateral bearing capacity of the innovative hybrid foundation system for offshore wind turbines by using traditional theories </concl>.
