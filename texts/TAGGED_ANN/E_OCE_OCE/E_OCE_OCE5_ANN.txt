<aim3>The two-dimensional water entry of wedges with different inclination angles is numerically investigated using a constrained interpolation profile (CIP)-based model, which is developed on the ground of a fixed Cartesian grid and governed by the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations </aim3>. <meth>A high-order finite difference method is employed as the flow solver, where the CIP method is used to discretize the convective term </meth>. <meth>The tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing/slope weighting (THINC/SW) is adopted to capture the free surface/interface, and an immersed boundary method is applied to simulate the motion of bodies </meth>. <meth>The present numerical model involving symmetric water entry is verified in comparison with the previous numerical and experimental results in the literature </meth>. <analy>The results of the asymmetric water entry are provided in terms of the penetration depth, velocity, pile-up coefficients, impact force of wedges, and velocity and pressure distributions of fluid </analy>. <analy>Considerable attention is paid into the effects of deadrise and inclination angles </analy>. <concl>It is found that the presence of the inclination angle significantly influences both the velocity and pressure field, and further regulates the penetration depth, velocity, pile-up coefficients, and impact force on the wedge </concl>. <concl>Specifically, wedges entering into the water with small deadrise angles are found to be more sensitive to the inclination angle than those with large deadrise angle </concl>.
