<aim3>For target search and tracking in unknown underwater environment, an integrated algorithm for a cooperative team of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (Multi-AUV) is proposed by combining the Glasius bio-inspired neural network (GBNN) and bio-inspired cascaded tracking control approach to improve search efficiency and reduce tracking errors </aim3>. <meth>Among them, the GBNN is mainly used to control a multi-AUV team in search of each targets </meth>. <meth>Once any target is found, the bio-inspired cascaded tracking control approach is applied to track it in case that it may escape </meth>. <meth>This integrated algorithm deals with various situations such as search for static or dynamic targets, and tracking of different trajectory in underwater environments with obstacles </meth>. <concl>The simulation results show that this integrated algorithm is of high efficiency and adaptability </concl>.
