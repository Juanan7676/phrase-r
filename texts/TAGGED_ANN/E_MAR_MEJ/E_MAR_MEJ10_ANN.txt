<intr>Diesel engines are widely used for the propulsion of marine vehicles and are exposed to uncertain working environment </intr>. <aim>In this paper, a robust nonlinear controller is proposed for a marine diesel engine that employees sliding mode control theory </aim>. <aim>The robust controller aims to maintain the desired diesel engine speed performance under harsh sea environment </aim>. <meth>The sliding surface has been carefully chosen that minimises the error in both angular velocity and acceleration </meth>. <aim>Robust control algorithm development and its tuning are also discussed <aim>. <aim3>The performance of the proposed nonlinear robust controller is investigated thoroughly and is compared with a classical Proportional–Integral–Differentiation controller with integral windup scheme </aim3>. <concl>Simulation results show that the proposed super-twisting-algorithm-based sliding mode controller can effectively improve the speed performance of the marine diesel engine in transient and steady operating conditions </concl>.
