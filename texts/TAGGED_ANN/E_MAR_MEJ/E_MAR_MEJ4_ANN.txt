<aim>In this study, a remote collecting system for ship operation energy efficiency was designed by using a tourist ship </aim>. <meth>According to measured data, the navigation environment factors of the ship were analysed statistically </meth>. <meth>The Gray correlation analysis was used to study the correlation degree among wind, water depth, water velocity and ship operation energy efficiency </meth>. <meth>On this basis, the Wuhan–Nanjing section of Yangtze River (upstream and downstream) was selected to analyse the law of wind speed effect on the energy efficiency of ship operation </meth>. <concl>The data analysis demonstrates that in different navigation environments, the ship energy efficiency can be significantly improved by optimising the main engine speed </concl>.
