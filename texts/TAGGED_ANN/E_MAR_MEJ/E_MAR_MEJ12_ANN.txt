<aim>This study introduces a three-dimensional fully nonlinear wave model, which solves the Laplace equation of the velocity potentials </aim>. <meth>A base-grid system is adopted in view of a transient curvilinear coordinate transformation along the vertical direction, while the horizontal coordinates remain uniformly distributed </meth>. <meth>To capture the variations of the free surface more accurately and effectively, the necessary denser grids can be specified within the vertically divided multi-plane layers near the free surface </meth>. <meth>In addition, fine grids can be arranged around the structures included in the flow domain </meth>. <analy>The model is first validated for the case of a solitary wave propagating along a narrow uniform-depth channel to investigate the level of solution improvement by the grid-refining technique </analy>. <meth>Smoothing is applied to remove the weak-fluctuation waves produced by the interpolation </meth>. <meth>In addition, the initial condition of the solitary wave is adjusted from the long-wave analytical solution to fit the presented fully nonlinear wave model </meth>. <concl>The results indicate that both efficiency and accuracy increase greatly by applying the fully nonlinear wave model as compared with a model using a uniformly non-refined grid system </concl>. <aim>Second, this model is applied to study a coastal problem related to a solitary wave diffracted by a surface-piercing square cylinder with or without a separating distance between the seabed and the bottom of the structure </aim>.
