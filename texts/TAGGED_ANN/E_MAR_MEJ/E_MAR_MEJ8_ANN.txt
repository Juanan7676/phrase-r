<state>Maritime ship collisions involving fishing boats have often been reported, and the major factors have been human error and unpredictable conditions </state>. <aim>This paper aims to create a set of collision-avoidance measures for operating fishing boats or a vessel traffic service by way of time and space management </aim>. <meth>It proposes a novel safe collision-avoidance safeguarding ring for navigational safety between operating fishing boats and merchant ships with a dummy automatic identification system (AIS) to enable fishing boats to establish a dynamic state when approaching ships under operation (fishing) </meth>. <meth>The approach method utilises the maximum relative speed, sea state, and escape time as three linguistic input variables for fuzzy logic control application </meth>. <analy>After the radius of the safeguarding ring is obtained and shown on a marine geographic information systems (MGIS) platform, the danger index of two ships is evaluated based on the area difference calculated through the MGIS </analy>. <meth>The software was installed in the dummy AIS receivers of fishing boats for experimentation in a Taiwan harbour </meth>. <concl>It was able to enhance the collision-avoidance ability of the operating fishing boats effectively and reduce marine disasters involving fishing boats </concl>.
