<state>With increasing interests in using LNG as a marine fuel, safety issues for LNG bunkering have brought about global discussion on establishing a safety exclusion zone around LNG bunkering areas </state>. <state>However, international consensus has yet to be reached in determining an appropriate extent of the zone to ensure safe liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunkering </state>. <aim3>The purpose of this study is to identify potential risks of LNG bunkering and to present a statistical method for determining the safe exclusion zone around LNG bunkering station with the help of a purpose-built computer program, integrated quantitative risk assessment (IQRA) </aim3>. <meth>A probabilistic risk assessment approach was adopted in this study to determine the safety exclusion zone for two case ships: one, a 300,000 DWT very large ore carrier (VLOC) and the other a 32,000 DWT bulk carrier </aim>. <meth>The results are then compared with those obtained by a deterministic approach and the discrepancies are discussed </meth>. <concl>It was found from this study that the frequency of bunkering is one of the key factors in determining the extent of safety exclusion zone </concl>. <concl>Thus, a somewhat surprising result of 36 m radius safety exclusion zone for the 32,000 DWT bulk carrier compared to 6.4 m radius for the 300,000 DWT VLOC was obtained </concl>. <concl>It was also found that the deterministic approach produced a much more extensive safety exclusion zone for the 300,000 DWT VLOC subjected to infrequent large-scale LNG bunkering operations compared to the probabilistic approach, while it was reasonably consistent with the probabilistic approach for the 32,000 DWT bulk carrier which uses frequent small-scale bunkering </concl>.
