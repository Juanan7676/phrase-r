<state>Developing ocean energy extraction, including ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), has been of interest to researchers for many decades </state>. <state>OTEC is a free fuel technology and could be used as a baseline power generation </state>. <mot>These advantages plus the engineering challenge have resulted in researchers striving to design and construct prototype devices </mot>. <meth>Making use of worldwide experience, all sections of a conceptual design including site selection, technical specifications and cost estimation were carried out for an Iranian OTEC power plant </meth>. <meth>A 5 MW closed cycle floating plant with an annual average temperature difference of 22°C was chosen at a 33 km distance from Chabahar harbour </meth>. <meth>Deep seawater would be extracted from 1000 m depth and would result in 3.52 MW of net power </meth>. <analy>According to cost calculations, the levelised cost of electricity of the plant has been estimated to be approximately 0.117 $/kWh, which is an acceptable level compared to other renewables </analy>. <concl>The conceptual OTEC design presented in this paper demonstrates a thermal potential in the Oman Sea which could assist with meeting the power demand for the southern coast of Iran </concl>.
