<intr>Ocean underwater vertical sensor structure is a kind of modern marine observation platform </intr>. <state>But most of the current ocean sensors work independently, and it lacks a suitable method to assemble them in a control system </state>. <state>Having good expansibility and convenient structure, the ocean buoy platform with contactless data transmission technology is possible to organise a long-term, real-time and autonomous working observation network </state>. <aim>The contactless data transmission model with a two-stage electromagnetic coupler is investigated </aim>. <aim3>A prototype of communication system using the differential phase shift keying method is constructed </aim3>. <analy>Due to attenuation in seawater, it is difficult to realise the long distance and low bit error rate transmission </analy>. <aim>To solve this problem, an equivalent two-terminal network model with compensation capacitor is proposed to make this contactless transmission system work at the resonance frequency </aim>. <state>In 1000 m deep sea experiment, the sensors equipped with this vertical structure based on buoy platform show a perfect similarity of conductivity points like a commercial conductivity, temperature and depth device </state>. <concl>It can be predicted that this underwater contactless data transmission method will be widely used to construct a multipoint distributed marine data network, and it can bring large scientific and economic values in deep sea exploration </concl>.
