<state>For LNG-Powered ships, cryogenic pipe bears ultralow temperature load; the stress of LNG pipe is very sensitive to the layout of pipe supports </state>. <aim3>In order to improve the safety of LNG pipe under complex loads, an optimisation design method for cryogenic pipe support layout (ODMCPSL) of LNG-Powered ships is proposed in this paper </aim3>. <aim>The objective of ODMCPSL is to deduce the structure stress, and both the pipe supports number and their positions are taken as variables </aim>. <meth>An improved genetic algorithm named Genetic Assimilation–Genetic Algorithm (GA–GA) is adopted in ODMCPSL, in which a new factor named magnetic factor (MF) is introduced in mutation operation and the number of pipe supports is optimised by MF </meth>. <state>In the algorithm, the number and positions of the pipe supports can be optimised at the same time </state>. <analy>ODMCPSL is applied to a dual-fuel harbour tug, and the maximum stress of the LNG pipe is significantly decreased by the optimisation of pipe supports </analy>. <concl>The engineering application example proves that ODMCPSL has high convergence and efficiency </concl>.
