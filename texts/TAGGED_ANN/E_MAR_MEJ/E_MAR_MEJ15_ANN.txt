<aim>This paper advocates the use of shipboard procedures as a strategy for bridging the knowledge gap </aim>. <aim2>It also recognises that an over-reliance reflects a failure to equip seafarers with the appropriate prior knowledge </aim2>. <state>Maritime accident reports frequently cite poor procedures as contributing factors towards maritime accidents </state>. <state>This may suggest a nexus among technical systems, seafarer competence, shipboard procedures and accidents at sea </state>. <aim>It is suggested in this paper that a holistic approach is needed to ensure that the approval of technical systems, seafarer training and written procedures are inextricably linked </aim>. <meth>Shipboard written procedures are described in terms of a negotiation of meaning between writer and seafarer, where successful execution of a shipboard task requires an accurate interpretation, by the seafarer, of the writer’s intentions </meth>. <concl>It is suggested that this may only be achieved by ensuring that seafarer prior knowledge is sufficient, writer’s anticipation of this knowledge is accurate and communication of new knowledge is explicit </concl>. <aim>This paper does not offer specific advice on the design of shipboard procedures; however, the process of acquiring a mental action plan is discussed </aim>. <meth>The factors that support or impede this acquisition are described and supported by a number of accident reports and academic studies </meth>.
