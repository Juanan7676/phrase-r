<state>Mental workload (MWL) is one of core elements of human factor construct reflecting arousal level, and its optimisation is crucial to maintain favourable operator functional state </state>. <state>However, sensible, reliable, and diagnostic measurement of MWL is essential for applications of adaptive aiding system design, usability testing, and seafarers’ training </state>. <aim>To develop robust MWL measures, 10 participants voluntarily participated in a simulator-based experiment study </aim>. <meth>During this study, the participants carried out standard four-level calibration tasks and simulated four-level maritime operation tasks, their heart rate and electroencephalogram (EEG) were continuously measured using a heart rate sensor and an ambulatory EEG device, which includes an accelerometer to distinguish signal corruption epochs induced by body movement artefact </meth>. <meth>After each task, NASA Task Load Index was collected as subjective measurement </meth>. <meth>One-way analysis of variance was used to test the sensitivity of MWL measures and Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated </meth>. <analy>The significantly sensitive indices for n-back task and simulator-based maritime operation task were different, supporting the limited cognitive resource pool theory </analy>. <concl>EEG features showed higher sensitivity than heart-rate-related measures </concl>.
