<aim>In this paper, a performance constrained fuzzy controller design is investigated for the nonlinear uncertain discrete-time ship steering system with complex noises </aim>. <meth>The performance constraints considered in this paper include individual state variance constraint and passivity constraint </meth>. <meth>The nonlinear discrete-time ship steering system considered in this paper is represented by a discrete-time Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model with perturbations, additional noise and multiplicative noise </meth>. <analy>According to this complex nonlinear discrete-time stochastic system, a fuzzy controller design approach is investigated based on Lyapunov theory, passivity theory and covariance control theory </analy>. <analy>Some sufficient conditions are derived to satisfy stability constraint, individual state variance constraint and passivity constraint, simultaneously </analy>. <meth>These sufficient conditions are constructed as linear matrix inequality forms that can be solved by the convex optimal programming algorithm </meth>. <concl>Finally, some simulation results are provided to verify the validity and applicability of the proposed fuzzy control approach with multiple performance constraints </concl>.
