<aim>This paper gives an overview of the development of the ILR-33 ”Amber” sounding rocket designated for microgravity experiments, that is under development at Institute of Aviation in Warsaw, Poland </aim>. <intr>The lack of an easily accessible and affordable platform for this kind of research was one of the key reasons for this work </intr>. <aimachiev>The proposed design enables performing experiments in microgravity for almost 150 seconds with an apogee over 100 km</aimachiev>. <meth>Combining these results with a relatively low price per launch and short deployment time gives a possibility to establish a firm position on the dynamic market</meth>. <aim>This article describes also the rocket structure and the vehicle's capabilities</aim>. <meth>The proposed design utilizes a hybrid rocket motor with High Test Peroxide as an oxidizer along with two reusable solid rocket boosters</meth>. <aim>The early phase analysis of the rocket configuration and propellant considerations are also presented in the paper</aim>. <concl> Furthermore, there have been already several on-ground test performed such as: wind tunnel research and motor firings. The proposed design is considered as an introduction to small launch vehicle technology </concl>.
