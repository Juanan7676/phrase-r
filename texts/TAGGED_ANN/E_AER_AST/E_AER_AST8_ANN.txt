<aim>An analytical model is developed to investigate the sound transmission loss from orthogonally rib-stiffened plates structure under diffuse acoustic field excitation</aim>. <meth>The validity and feasibility of the model are verified by comparing the present theoretical predictions with numerical and experimental results published previously </meth>. <concl>The influences of modal coupling terms, boundary condition and stiffener spacing on sound power and sound transmission loss are subsequently presented</concl>. <concl>Numerical discussion of the model demonstrates the significant influence of both boundary conditions and stiffener spacing upon the mode shape, sound power and sound transmission loss for stiffened plate, wherein sound power decreases and sound transmission loss increases as the amount of constraint increases </concl>.
