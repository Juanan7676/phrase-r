<aim>In this paper, a new method for predicting hypersonic three-dimensional (3D) boundary layer transition is developed </intr>. <meth>It is based on the REo/Me criterion for streamwise instability and on the Recf,new criterion for crossflow instability</meth>. <meth>An intermittency function is also formulated and applied to combine laminar and turbulent flows</meth>. <meth>Additionally, a computational grid pretreating method, compatible with modern computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques based on parallel execution is adopted in order to obtain the boundary layer parameters </meth>. <analy>Four criteria are compared to define the boundary layer edge</analy>. <meth>A HIFiRE-5 elliptic cone at different Reynolds numbers is adopted to validate the performance of the criteria-based transition model and the effectiveness of the four criteria for boundary layer edge definition</meth>. <concl>The results show that the boundary layer edge of complex hypersonic 3D flows could be obtained properly with the computational grid pretreating method and the combination of h0/h0,infty=0.995 and  criteria</concl>.<concl> Moreover, the computed  and  distributions in the region between the leading edge and the centerline are similar to the N-factor for streamwise and crossflow instabilities from linear parabolized stability equation (PSE) methods </concl>. The shape and trend of the transition onsets predicted by the criteria-based transition model between the centerline and leading edge of HIFiRE-5 agree well with the experiment. <reco>However, as for the transition on the centerline, which is dominated by the inflection point in streamwise velocity profiles, using the criteria-based transition model related to boundary layer thickness would predict the transition onset prematurely </reco>.
