<aim>The measured HART (Higher harmonic control Aeroacoustic Rotor Test) I data in a descending flight condition is validated using various numerical approaches including CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics)–CSD (Computational Structural Dynamics) coupled analyses with isolated rotor model and rotor-fuselage model </aim>. <meth>A CSD-alone approach is also conducted for reference purpose. A three-dimensional (3D) compressible RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes) flow solver is employed for the CFD code </meth>. <concl>Good convergence behavior is found for both coupling analyses </concl>. <concl>It is observed that the rotor-fuselage model improves the correlation significantly as compared with the measured data</concl>. <concl>Specifically, the highly oscillating section normal forces signals marked in the advancing and retreating sides of the rotor are captured accurately </concl>. <meth>Detailed harmonic analysis and the gradient of the airloads signals are observed to prove the validity of the prediction model</meth>. <concl>The upwash induced due to a fuselage as well as the increased vorticity over the rotor flow fields are attributed to the enhanced correlation</concl>. <concl>The predicted blade elastic motions and structural moments also indicate improvements with the present rotor-fuselage model </concl>.
