<aim>This paper investigates the micro- and nano-mechanical behavior of orthotropic doubly-curved shells by considering the New Modified Couple Stress Theory (NMCST) </aim>. <meth>The higher order continuum assumed by the NMCST includes three material length scale parameters in order to capture the size-effect of anisotropic and orthotropic materials </meth>. <meth>The governing equations of the problem are based on the First-order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) </meth>. <meth>According to the proposed NMCST, the expressions of the physical components for the strain and curvature tensors are obtained in an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system </meth>. <meth>Then, the governing differential equations and boundary conditions are derived by applying the energy method and Hamilton's principle </meth>. <concl>A comparative investigation between our numerical results and the ones available in the literature proves the capability of the proposed formulation in predicting the micro- and nano-mechanical behavior of orthotropic doubly-curved shells </concl>.
