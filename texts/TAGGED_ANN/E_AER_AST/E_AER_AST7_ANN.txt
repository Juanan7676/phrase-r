<intr>It is envisaged that the next generation of civil large turbofan engines will be designed for greater bypass ratios when compared to contemporary architectures </intr> <mot>The underlying motivation is to reduce specific thrust and improve propulsive efficiency </mot>. <intr>Concurrently, the aerodynamic performance of the exhaust system is anticipated to play a key role in the success of future engine architectures </intr>. <intr>The transonic flow topology downstream of the bypass nozzle can be significantly influenced by the after-body geometry </intr>. <intr>This behavior is further complicated by the existence of the air-flow vent on the nozzle after-body which can have an impact on the performance of the exhaust system </intr>. <aim>This paper aims to investigate the aerodynamics associated with the geometry of the bypass nozzle after-body and to establish guidelines for the design of separate-jet exhausts with respect to future large turbofan engines </aim>. <meth>A parametric geometry definition has been derived based on Class-Shape Transformation (CST) functions for the representation of post-nozzle-exit components such as after-bodies, plugs, and air-flow vents</meth>. <meth>The developed method has been coupled with an automatic mesh generation and a Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) flow solution method, thus devising an integrated aerodynamic design tool </meth>. <meth>A cost-effective optimization strategy has been implemented consisting of methods for Design Space Exploration (DSE), Response Surface Modeling (RSM), and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) </meth>. <meth>The combined approach has been deployed to explore the aerodynamic design space associated with the bypass nozzle after-body geometry for a Very High Bypass Ratio (VHBR) turbofan engine with separate-jet exhausts</meth>. <meth>A detailed investigation has been carried out to expose the transonic flow mechanisms associated with the effect of after-body curvature combined with the impact of the air-flow vent </meth>. <analy>A set of optimum curved after-body geometries has been obtained, with each subsequently compared against their respective conical representation </analy>. <concl>The obtained results suggest that no significant performance improvements can be obtained through curving the nozzle after-body relative to the case of a conical design </concl>. <analy>However, it is shown that the application of surface curvature has the potential to unlock new parts in the design space that allow analysts to reduce the required after-body length without any loss in aerodynamic performance </analy>. <concl>The developed approach complements the existing tool-set of enabling technologies for the design and optimization of future large aero-engines, consequently leading to increased thrust and reduced Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) </concl>.
