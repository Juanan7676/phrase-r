<intr>In today's competitive environment, new turbomachinery designs need to be not only more efficient, quieter, and “greener” but also need to be developed at on much shorter time scales and at lower costs </intr>. <state>A number of advanced optimization strategies have been developed to achieve these requirements </state>. <aim>This paper reviews recent progress in turbomachinery design optimization to solve real-world aerodynamic problems, especially for compressors and turbines </aim>. <meth>This review covers the following topics that are important for optimizing turbomachinery designs, (1) optimization methods, (2) stochastic optimization combined with blade parameterization methods and the design of experiment methods, (3) gradient-based optimization methods for compressors and turbines and (4) data mining techniques for Pareto Fronts </meth>. <aim> We also present our own insights regarding the current research trends and the future optimization of turbomachinery designs </aim>.
