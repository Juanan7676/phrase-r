<aim>Current advances in experimental and computational studies of three-dimensional (3-D) near-wall turbulent flows in streamwise corners (SC) including the boundary-layer transition are reviewed </aim>. <aim>The focus is the structure, properties and main regularities of such flows in a wide range of variable conditions and basic parameters </aim>. <meth>A variety of different kinds of near-wall streamwise corner flows is displayed </meth>. <analy>Analysis of approaches for modeling of the near-wall corner flow in laboratory experiment is given </analy>. <aim2>The problem of simulation of such flows where some ambiguities remain is discussed </aim2>. <analy>The main factors on the structure of the flow in streamwise corners are analyzed </analy>. <analy>Also, the effectiveness of flow control by streamwise vortices in the junction regions of aerodynamic surfaces is shown </analy>. <concl>Finally, some important properties of the modified near-wall turbulent corner flows which have been revealed experimentally, in particular, for the flow near the wing/body junction (WBJ), can be used as an attractive alternative for real applications </concl>.
