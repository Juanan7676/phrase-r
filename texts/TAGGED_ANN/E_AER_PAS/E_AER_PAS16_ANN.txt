<intr>Marine robots are a developing topic for military, scientific, and environmental missions <intr>. <state>However, most existing marine robots are either limited to flight or limited to swimming </state>. <mot>Therefore, the combination of both provides endless possibilities for tasks, such as espionage, pollution and marine wildlife surveillance, and border protection </mot>. <meth>Applying bioinspiration and biomimetics not only camouflages the robot, but also increases the efficiency of already perfected designs </meth>. <aim>Because bioinspiration and aerial-aquatic locomotion are the main attraction for this article, this review gathers the characteristics of aerial-aquatic animals useful for such designs </aim>. <aim2>These animals are diving birds and flying fish, specifically plunge-diving birds, surface-diving birds, both plunge- and surface-diving birds, two-winger flying fish, and four-winger flying fish </aim2>. <aim>The overview of the current marine bioinspired and non-bioinspired robots that are both aerial and aquatic are also presented, followed by the limitations and recommendations of the bioinspired robots </aim>. <meth>It is shown by a comparison between the bioinspired robot and its corresponding animal that the existing robotic systems are not truly bioinspired </meth>. <analy>The main traits these systems are missing are replicating the exact weight, size, muscle movement, and skin texture of the biological animal </analy>. <concl>In order to have efficient robots, bioinspiration needs to be perfected </concl>. <concl>Doing so requires not only the basic design to be replicated, but every detail of the system to be imitated </concl>.
