<intr>Applications based on quad-rotor-vehicles (QRV) are becoming increasingly wide-spread </intr>. <state>Many of these applications require accurate mathematical representations for control design, simulation and estimation </state>. <state>However, there is no consensus on a standardized model for these purposes </state>. <aim>In this article a review of the most common elements included in QRVmodels reported in the literature is presented </aim>. <aim>This survey shows that some elements are recurrent for typical non-aerobatic QRV applications; in particular, for control design and high-performance simulation </aim>. <meth> By synthesising the common features of the reviewed models a standard generic model SGM is proposed </meth>. <meth>The SGM is cast as a typical state-space model without memory-less transformations, a structure which is useful for simulation and controller design </meth>. <concl>The survey also shows that many QRV applications use simplified representations, which may be considered simplifications of the SGM here proposed <concl>. <aim>In order to assess the effectiveness of the simplified models, a comprehensive comparison based on digital simulations is presented </aim>. <aim>With this comparison, it is possible to determine the accuracy of each model under particular operating ranges </aim>. <state>Such information is useful for the selection of a model according to a particular application </state>. <aim> In addition to the models found in the literature, in this article a novel simplified model is derived </aim>. <concl>The main characteristics of this model are that its inner dynamics are linear, it has low complexity and it has a high level of accuracy in all the studied operating ranges, a characteristic found only in more complex representations </concl>. <analy>To complement the article the main elements of the SGM are evaluated with the aid of experimental data and the computational complexity of all surveyed models is briefly analysed </analy>. <conc>Finally, the article presents a discussion on how the structural characteristics of the models are useful to suggest particular QRV control structures </concl>.
