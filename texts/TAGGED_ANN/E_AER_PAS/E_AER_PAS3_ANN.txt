<intr>There is much effort being directed towards the development of safety regulations for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) </intr>. <state>National airworthiness authorities have advocated the adoption of a risk-based approach, whereby regulations are driven by the outcomes of a systematic process to assess and manage identified safety risks </state>. <state>Subsequently, models characterising the primary hazards associated with UAS operations have now become critical to the development of regulations and in turn, to the future of the industry </state>. <state>Key to the development of airworthiness regulations for UAS is a comprehensive understanding of the risks UAS operations pose to people and property on the ground </state>. <state>A comprehensive review of the literature identified 33 different models (and component sub models) used to estimate ground risk posed by UAS </state>. <state>These models comprise failure, impact location, recovery, stress, exposure, incident stress and harm sub-models </state>. <state>The underlying assumptions and treatment of uncertainties in each of these sub-models differ significantly between models, which can have a significant impact on the development of regulations </state>. <aim>This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in research into UAS ground risk modelling, discusses how the various sub-models relate to the different components of the regulation, and explores how model-uncertainties potentially impact the development of regulations for UAS </aim>.
