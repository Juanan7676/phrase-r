<aim3>The recent progress in developing pseudocapacitive electrodes is summarized, focusing on the three-dimensional (3D) binder-free nanoarchitecture design, including 3D-porous-metal- and graphene-based electrodes, as well as metal-atom/ion-doping-enhanced electrodes, for advanced pseudocapacitors with comparable energy density to batteries, high power density, and excellent cycling stability </aim3>
