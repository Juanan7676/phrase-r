<aim>This work explores the collision process at foot contact in models of legged robots </aim>. <aim>In particular, we highlight that for legged systems the widely used assumption of no sliding of the contact points can yield inconsistent outcomes </aim>. <state>For certain contact configurations and system parameters, neither the assumption of lift-off of the trailing foot nor the assumption that it stays fixed on the ground yield valid solutions </state>. <state>The foot will slide, even if an infinite coefficient of friction is assumed </state>. <aim>In a related effect, we present configurations in which the solution of the collision process is ambiguous </aim>. <meth>These behaviors are examined for the models of a minimalistic biped, a passive dynamic walker, and the five-link bipedal robot RAMone </meth>. <aim>The paper provides background for these non-intuitive behaviors and investigates the influence of system parameters onto the collision behavior of a passive dynamic walker </aim>. <concl>By studying bipedal models that range from minimalistic to physically accurate, this paper establishes a bridge between the theoretical study of unilateral contact in multibody dynamic simulations and the application of these simulation methods in the modeling of ground contact in actual legged systems </concl>.
