<aim>In this paper, we address the problem of controlling a mobile stereo camera under image quantization noise </meth>. <meth>Assuming that a pair of images of a set of targets is available, the camera moves through a sequence of Next-Best-Views (NBVs), i.e. a sequence of views that minimizes the trace of the targets’ cumulative state covariance, constructed using a realistic model of the stereo rig that captures image quantization noise and a Kalman Filter (KF) that fuses the observation history with new information </meth>
