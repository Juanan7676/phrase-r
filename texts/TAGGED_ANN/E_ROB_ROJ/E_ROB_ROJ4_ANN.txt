<aim>The proposed algorithm decomposes control into two stages: first the NBV is computed in the camera relative coordinates, and then the camera moves to realize this view in the fixed global coordinate frame </aim>. <concl>This decomposition allows the camera to drive to a new pose that effectively realizes the NBV in camera coordinates while satisfying Field-of-View constraints in global coordinates, a task that is particularly challenging using complex sensing models </concl>. <meth>We provide simulations and real experiments that illustrate the ability of the proposed mobile camera system to accurately localize sets of targets </meth>. <aim>We also propose a novel data-driven technique to characterize unmodeled uncertainty, such as calibration errors, at the pixel level and show that this method ensures stability of the KF </aim>.
