<intr>Magnetotactic bacteria MC-1 (MTB) synthesize a chain of magnetic nanoparticles called magnetosomes to navigate in deep-sea environments by orienting themselves in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic field </intr>. <state>MTB’s inherent mobility and ability to be controlled by exposition to an external magnetic field has become of increasing interest for micromanipulation and drug transport applications</state>. <state>In the traditional control schemes, MTB were oriented by exposure to an external magnetic field causing them to align with the magnetic field lines</state>. <state>Directional changes were applied below a critical frequency and, as such, MTB were still able to swim along the generated magnetic field lines </state>. <aim3>The approach presented here proposes to apply to the MTB an oscillating magnetic field with a frequency beyond a critical limit to in order to exploit the time averaging magnetic field motion behavior of the bacteria cells </aim3>. <concl>Results indicate that a time-multiplexed magnetic field made of various directional cycling fields can control the MTB more efficiently with less power, which is an advantage for future human-scale medical applications </concl>.
