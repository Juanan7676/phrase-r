<intr>Tethered mobile robots are useful for exploration in steep, rugged, and dangerous terrain </intr>. <state>A tether can provide a robot with robust communications, power, and mechanical support, but also constrains motion </state>. <state>In cluttered environments, the tether will wrap around a number of intermediate ‘anchor points’, complicating navigation </state>. <concl>We show that by measuring the length of tether deployed and the bearing to the most recent anchor point, we can formulate a tethered simultaneous localization and mapping (TSLAM) problem that allows us to estimate the pose of the robot and the positions of the anchor points, using only low-cost, nonvisual sensors </concl>. <analy>This information is used by the robot to safely return along an outgoing trajectory while avoiding tether entanglement </analy>. <mot>We are motivated by TSLAM as a building block to aid conventional, camera, and laser-based approaches to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which tend to fail in dark and or dusty environments </mot>. <state>Unlike conventional range-bearing SLAM, the TSLAM problem must account for the fact that the tether-length measurements are a function of the robot’s pose and all the intermediate anchor-point positions </state>. <meth>While this fact has implications on the sparsity that can be exploited in our method, we show that a solution to the TSLAM problem can still be found and formulate two approaches: (i) an online particle filter based on FastSLAM and (ii) an efficient, offline batch solution </meth>. <concl>We demonstrate that either method outperforms odometry alone, both in simulation and in experiments using our TReX (Tethered Robotic eXplorer) mobile robot operating in flat-indoor and steep-outdoor environments </concl>. <concl>For the indoor experiment, we compare each method using the same dataset with ground truth, showing that batch TSLAM outperforms particle-filter TSLAM in localization and mapping accuracy, owing to superior anchor-point detection, data association, and outlier rejection </concl>.
