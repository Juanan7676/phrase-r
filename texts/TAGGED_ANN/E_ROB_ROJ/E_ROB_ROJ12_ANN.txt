<aim>This study presents a theoretical method for planning and controlling agile bipedal locomotion based on robustly tracking a set of non-periodic keyframe states </aim>. <meth>Based on centroidal momentum dynamics, we formulate a hybrid phase-space planning and control method that includes the following key components: (i) a step transition solver that enables dynamically tracking non-periodic keyframe states over various types of terrain; (ii) a robust hybrid automaton to effectively formulate planning and control algorithms; (iii) a steering direction model to control the robot’s heading; (iv) a phase-space metric to measure distance to the planned locomotion manifolds; and (v) a hybrid control method based on the previous distance metric to produce robust dynamic locomotion under external disturbances </meth>. <analy>Compared with other locomotion methodologies, we have a large focus on non-periodic gait generation and robustness metrics to deal with disturbances</analy>. <concl>This focus enables the proposed control method to track non-periodic keyframe states robustly over various challenging terrains and under external disturbances, as illustrated through several simulations </concl>.
