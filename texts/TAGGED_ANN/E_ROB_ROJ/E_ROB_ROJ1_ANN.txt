<aim3>This paper describes a data set collected with an autonomous underwater vehicle testbed in the unstructured environment of an underwater cave complex </aim3>. <meth>The vehicle is equipped with two mechanically scanned imaging sonar sensors to simultaneously map the caves horizontal and vertical surfaces, a Doppler velocity log, two inertial measurement units, a depth sensor, and a vertically mounted camera imaging the sea floor for ground truth validation at specific points <meth>. <analy>The testbed collected the data in July 2013, guided by a human diver, to sidestep autonomous navigation in a complex environment </analy>. <meth>For ease of use, the original robot operating system bag files are provided together with a version combining imagery and human-readable text files for processing on other environments </meth>.
