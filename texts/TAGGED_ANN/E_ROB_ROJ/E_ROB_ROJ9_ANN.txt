<state>3D visual attention plays an important role in both human and robotics perception that yet has to be explored in full detail </state>. <state>However, the majority of computer vision and robotics methods are concerned only with 2D visual attention </state>. <aim>This survey presents findings and approaches that cover 3D visual attention in both human and robot vision, summarizing the last 30 years of research and also looking beyond computational methods </aim>. <meth>First, we present work in such fields as biological vision and neurophysiology, studying 3D attention in human observers </meth>. <meth>This provides a view of the role attention plays at the system level for biological vision </meth>. <meth>Then, we cover computer and robot vision approaches that take 3D visual attention into account </meth>. <concl>We compare approaches with respect to different categories, such as feature-based, data-based, or depth-based visual attention, and draw conclusions on what advances will help robotics to cope better with complex real-world settings and tasks </concl>.
