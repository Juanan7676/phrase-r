<aim3>We propose a novel framework of haptic rendering and interactive simulation, which, by exploiting midpoint time integration, that is known for its superior energy-conserving property but has not yet been adopted for haptics and interactive simulation, can enforce discrete-time passivity of the simulation effectively in practice, while retaining real-time interactivity due to its being non-iterative </aim3>. <meth>We derive this passive midpoint integration (PMI) simulation for mechanical systems both in maximal coordinates (i.e. in SE(3)) and in generalized coordinates (i.e. inℜnℜn ), with some potential actions as well to implement joint articulation, constraints, compliance, and so on </meth>. <meth>We also fully incorporate multi-point Coulomb frictional contact into them via the PMI-LCP (linear complementarity problem) formulation </meth>. <concl>The proposed PMI-based simulation framework is applied to some illustrative examples to demonstrate its advantages: (1) haptic rendering of a peg-in-hole task, where very light/stiff articulated objects can be simulated with multi-point contact; (2) haptic interaction with a flexible beam, where marginally stable/lossless behavior (i.e. vibration) can be stably emulated; and (3) under-actuated tendon-driven hand grasping, where mixed maximal-generalized coordinates are used with very light/stiff fingers </concl>.
